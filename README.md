## Mystery-Object
This project contains a "mystery" object to test the use of Git for tracing projects. The object will be built up by members of the team adding their own traces to the XML files in this repository.

## Invitation
Each member of the Reconstruct team is encouraged to clone this repository and work on a few sections of the "mystery object" in Reconstruct. When you've added a trace or two (or modified someone else's traces), please commit and push your changes back to the GitHub repository and see what kinds of conflicts arise. Eventually, the entire object should be completed by the team.

## The "Mystery Object" so far (May 21st, 2018) with sections 1-15 and 30-35 completed:
