# Mystery-Object
This project contains a "mystery" object to test the use of Git for tracing projects.

## Invitation
Each member of the Reconstruct team is encouraged to clone this repository and work on a few sections of the "mystery object" in Reconstruct. When you've added a trace or two (or modified someone else's traces), please commit and push your changes back to the GitHub repository to see what kinds of conflicts arise.
